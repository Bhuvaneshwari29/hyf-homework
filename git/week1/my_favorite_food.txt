Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.[1][2][3] It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.[4] Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as parts of Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq.[5]
